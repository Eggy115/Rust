## What is Rust

C# is a programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a modern, object-oriented language that is used to develop a wide variety of applications, including desktop and mobile apps, web services, games, and more. C# is a popular language among developers due to its ease of use, extensive libraries, and tight integration with the .NET framework.

## Installation

### Installing Rust

These are the general steps to install Rust on different platforms. However, the exact steps may vary depending on the specific operating system and version you are using. It's always a good idea to refer to the official documentation for your platform to get more detailed installation instructions.

#### Windows

1. Download the Rust installation executable from the official Rust website.
2. Run the downloaded file and follow the installation instructions.
3. Once the installation is complete, you can use any text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to write and compile Rust code.

#### Linux

1. Install Rust using the package manager for your Linux distribution. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install rustc
```

2. Once Rust is installed, you can use any text editor or IDE to write and compile Rust code.

#### macOS

1. Install Rust using the Homebrew package manager for macOS. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```
brew install rust
```

2. Once Rust is installed, you can use any text editor or IDE to write and compile Rust code.

Alternatively, you can also download the Rust installation package for macOS from the official Rust website and follow the installation instructions.

### Installing Repository

You can download individual files, copy & paste code, or clone the repository

```

```
      
## Usage

- To run a Rust program, you'll need to compile it first.       
- Once you have downloaded the scripts, build the project, which will compile the code into an executable file. In Visual Studio, you can do this by selecting "Build" from the menu bar and then clicking `Build Solution`.     
- Run the executable file by double-clicking it or running it from the command line. In Visual Studio, you can run the program by selecting "Start" from the menu bar or by pressing the `F5` key.
