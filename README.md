## What is Rust

Rust is a modern, multi-paradigm programming language that aims to provide the performance of low-level languages like C and C++ while also providing the safety and memory management of high-level languages like Java and Python. It was created by Mozilla in 2010 and has since gained popularity among developers for its speed, memory safety, and concurrency features.

Rust is a statically-typed language, meaning that the types of variables and expressions are known at compile time, which can catch many errors before the code is run. Rust also includes a powerful ownership and borrowing system, which ensures that memory is allocated and deallocated correctly at compile time, preventing common bugs like null pointer dereferences and use-after-free errors.

Rust has a modern syntax, with features like pattern matching, closures, and type inference, making it easy to write concise and expressive code. It also has a large and growing ecosystem of libraries and tools, including a package manager called Cargo, which makes it easy to manage dependencies and build projects.

Overall, Rust is a powerful language that combines the performance of low-level languages with the safety and ease-of-use of high-level languages. It's used for a wide range of applications, from systems programming and operating systems to web development and game development.

## Installation

### Installing Rust

These are the general steps to install Rust on different platforms. However, the exact steps may vary depending on the specific operating system and version you are using. It's always a good idea to refer to the official documentation for your platform to get more detailed installation instructions.

#### Windows

1. Download the Rust installation executable from the official Rust website.
2. Run the downloaded file and follow the installation instructions.
3. Once the installation is complete, you can use any text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to write and compile Rust code.

#### Linux

1. Install Rust using the package manager for your Linux distribution. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install rustc
```

2. Once Rust is installed, you can use any text editor or IDE to write and compile Rust code.

#### macOS

1. Install Rust using the Homebrew package manager for macOS. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```
brew install rust
```

2. Once Rust is installed, you can use any text editor or IDE to write and compile Rust code.

Alternatively, you can also download the Rust installation package for macOS from the official Rust website and follow the installation instructions.

### Installing Repository

You can download individual files, copy & paste code, or clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Eggy115/Rust.git
```
      
## Usage

- To run a Rust program, you'll need to compile it first.       
- Once you have downloaded the scripts, build the project, which will compile the code into an executable file. In Visual Studio, you can do this by selecting "Build" from the menu bar and then clicking `Build Solution`.     
- Run the executable file by double-clicking it or running it from the command line. In Visual Studio, you can run the program by selecting "Start" from the menu bar or by pressing the `F5` key.
